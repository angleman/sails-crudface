sails-crudface
==============

**A [sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) node module for "systematic" scrud interface generation with MVC architecture.**

If you want sails generate views on the fly for your models, you can use this module and create a configuration file describing the fields and the layout you need for every controller/model.

Often for data entry is not needed complexity but simplicity.
Also, writing the code for the view part of the MVC architecture is a repetitive task, because you may want a standard layout for toolbars, buttons, lists, and so on.

sails-crudface automates the task of creating the user interface for search and entry of data.

The resulting user interface is plain and responsive HTML with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download)
